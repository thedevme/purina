    	 <h1>Do dogs and cats get TMJ problems the way humans do?</h1> <p class="medium">The temporomandibular joint, or TMJ, is a hinge joint that lets your jaw open and close. Problems with it can occur in pets as well as people.</p> <p class="medium">Inflammation, developmental structure, and trauma are a few ways your pet can end up with a TMJ that isn't functioning properly. As a result, your pet may be unable to eat without pain, or in a severe case, may be unable to open his mouth at all!</p> <p class="medium">Problems with TMJ are generally diagnosed by a pet dentist through radiography or CT scans. It's important to investigate possible TMJ problems promptly, because many get worse over time, and can cause discomfort for your pet until they are treated. For more information, talk to your veterinarian.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
