    	<h1>My dog is misbehaving. Who might I ask for help?</h1> <p class="medium">If you adopt a puppy, you might enroll her in a training class to learn basic commands. But if you have a dog with behavioral problems such as aggression, fear, or phobias, you might need to seek a different kind of help.</p> <p class="medium">Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist, Suzanne Hetts, says that instead of using a punishment-based system, an animal behaviorist will demonstrate how to use positive reinforcement to train your pup. She'll work with you to create learning experiences that give you the opportunity to ask yourself: "how can i get my dog to do what i want him to do so i can reward him for it?&quot;</p> <p class="medium">Your veterinarian, a local animal shelter, or the council for certification of professional dog trainers can help you find a local behaviorist.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
