    	<h1>Exercising with your Dog Checklist</h1><p class="medium">Keeping your dog fit through exercise helps them lead happier, healthier lives. Here are a few tips to get you started:<ul><li>Energetic dogs do best with a fun, high-energy activity like fetching a ball or a flying disc.</li><li>Leisurely walks may be best for an older dog.</li><li>Go slow. For dogs who haven't exercised regularly, start out slow and work your way up with the intensity of their activities.</li><li>Start easy. Begin walking or running your dog on soft surfaces such as dirt, sand or grass until his pads toughen.</li><li>Easy boy. Avoid exercising your dog immediately before or after he's eaten.</li><li>Watch the weather-hot or cold. The summer sun can cause dehydration, or worse heat stroke. Be sure your dog has easy access to water all day, every day!</li><li>Keep an eye out. Dogs can pick up foxtail, seeds dirt and ticks so be sure to check their eyes, coat, and feet.</li><li>Mind your manners! Train your dog to walk at your side to help control them from jumping on children, other dogs or adults.</li><li>Be safe. Talk to your veterinarian before starting any new exercise program.</li></p>
