    	<h1>What are some possible reasons for infertility in a male cat?</h1> <p class="medium">Infertility in male tomcats is not usually a problem - unless you're a cat breeder with a valuable, champion tom that can't fulfill its reproductive obligations.</p> <p class="medium">Veterinarians who specialize in reproductive disorders will conduct a microscopic examination of the tomcat's sperm. Is it "motile&quot; and able to move about spontaneously? And does the sperm have the proper "morphology&quot; - the necessary form and structure?</p> <p class="medium">Other conditions that can affect the fertility of male cats include malnutrition, obesity, too much liver in the cat's diet, and hypothyroidism. Sometimes it just comes down to weak libido. Luckily there are treatments for most of these problems.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
