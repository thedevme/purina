    	<h1>How can I keep my dog from pulling on the leash so much?</h1> <p class="medium">If your dog is pulling on its leash, experts say both you and fido have developed a very bad habit. To get him to walk on a leash without pulling, you must change your behavior. Put him on his leash, ask him to heel, and then move forward when the leash is not tight.</p> <p class="medium">If he pulls on the leash at all, stop right away and don't move. When your dog turns to look back, call him back to heel position, and start again. If he pulls on the leash, stop and repeat the process. Move forward only when the leash is loose.</p> <p class="medium">It will be slow and frustrating at first. Leash-pulling is a hard habit to break. But if you persevere and are consistent about not allowing the dog to pull you anywhere, Fido will eventually stop pulling on his leash.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
