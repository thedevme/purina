    	<h1>My cat is slightly overweight. How much weight can she safely lose in a month?</h1> <p class="medium">Pet owners who equate food with love may literally be killing their cats with kindness. Feline obesity leads to a host of diseases, including premature death. But if you decide to put your kitty on a weight loss diet, be sure to do it safely.</p> <p class="medium">About a quarter to half a pound a month is safe, so if you've got a kitty who is eighteen pounds but should be twelve pounds, then that's going to take a year.</p> <p class="medium">Veterinarian Margee Scherk, Editor of the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery says that to lose weight, cats - like any species - must expend more calories than they eat. So make sure that fat cat gets some exercise!</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
