    	<h1>Could the pesticides and fertilizers I use on my lawn be dangerous to my pet?</h1> <p class="medium">If you plan to use pesticides or fertilizers on your lawn, be mindful of your cat or dog. You may want to keep your pet indoors for twenty-four hours after applying any chemicals to your yard.</p> <p class="medium">But don't panic. Lawn chemicals may irritate your pet when he licks his paws, but if they're properly applied, they very rarely can poison a pet. Puddles of herbicides or pesticides, however, could be dangerous, so make sure to clean up any spills before your pet gets to them.</p> <p class="medium">Research has also shown an increase in a type of cancer called lymphoma in dogs that have been exposed to the herbicide two-four-d. So make sure to read the labels of the products you use, and take precautions accordingly.</p> <br><i>Dr. Andrea Looney, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
