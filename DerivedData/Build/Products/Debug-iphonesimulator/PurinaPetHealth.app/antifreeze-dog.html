        <h1>Why do I need to keep my pet from antifreeze?</h1> 
        <p class="medium">Antifreeze makes your car run better in the summertime and wintertime, but it's dangerous to your pet. Ethylene glycol, the antifreeze that's commonly used in automobile radiators, is very toxic to pets. As little as a tablespoon can kill a cat and a couple of ounces can kill a dog. Unfortunately, animals will readily ingest it because it tastes and smells so sweet.</p> <p class="medium">So if you have pets, make sure to clean up any leaking antifreeze. And if you're worried that your pet has ingested some, call your veterinarian or the National Animal Poison Control Hotline right away. Your veterinarian may suggest that you administer hydrogen peroxide to induce vomiting.</p>
