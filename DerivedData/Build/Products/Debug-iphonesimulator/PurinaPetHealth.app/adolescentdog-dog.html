    	<h1>What behavioral training should I give my adolescent dog?</h1> <p class="medium">Of all the life stages in the career of a well-behaved dog, adolescence can be the most trying. The innocence of puppyhood is passed, thanks to the onset of puberty. A young dog's mind strays to thoughts of... well, you remember your adolescent years in school. And that sticker on your locker that said "challenge authority?"</p> <p class="medium">You, human companion, are the authority now. Keep that dog in school. If he got an "A" in basic obedience, he's ready for advanced placement. A learning dog is a happy dog. Canine sports training - running, jumping, learning new skills in the company of other dogs - any kind of class can be behavior training, too.</p> <p class="medium">Life with an adolescent dog is an education. Be the teacher he'll never forget.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
