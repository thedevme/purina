    	<h1>What should I look for in the food for a cat that needs to lose weight?</h1> <p class="medium">What's one all-American solution to feline obesity? An Atkins - or "catkins"-style diet for cats. Veterinarian Margee Scherk, Editor of the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery, approves. For cats to lose weight, we want to use a higher protein food that's also lower in carbohydrate.</p> <p class="medium">Wild cat foods, such as birds or mice, naturally fit this profile. But to get your flabby Fluffy back in shape, must you share your steak dinner? Or worse, shop for mice? A high-protein, low carb diet for your cat need not involve prime rib - or rodents! Suitable cat foods can be found at your veterinarian's office or in your local supermarket's pet food aisle.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
