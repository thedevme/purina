     <h1>Emergency First Aid Tips</h1> 
     <p class="medium">In an emergency, keep a level head and quickly get your dog to the veterinarian. Call first. If your doctor's office is not open, call the nearest emergency pet clinic. Keep emergency phone numbers near your telephone.</p> <p class="medium">Unless you have been trained and are absolutely positive you can administer CPR to your dog, it is best, and safer, to seek immediate veterinary care.</p> <p class="medium">However, there are some things you can do or avoid doing to help your dog before you get him to the hospital/clinic as soon as possible:</p> <ul><li>Wrap your dog in a heavy towel or blanket to keep him warm and restrict his movements. Having assistance would be helpful.</li> <li>Apply a pressure bandage (sterile gauze or a clean handkerchief) to stem or stop the bleeding of a cut or bite.</li> <li>Apply cold compress to a burn and gently hold it there until you get to the veterinary clinic.</li> <li>Do not induce vomiting even if you suspect or know your dog has swallowed a poisonous substance.</li> <li>At any sign of choking (drooling, difficulty swallowing, pawing at the mouth, gagging), do not attempt to remove the item.</li> <li>If your dog suffers heatstroke, take him to a cool spot and sponge him with cold water. Encourage your dog to drink small amounts of water.</li></ul> <p class="medium">If your dog suffers frostbite, place him in a warm room immediately. Thaw out the frostbitten areas slowly by applying warm moist towels that are changed frequently until the area becomes flushed. Severe frostbite can result in damaged paws and ear tips, so it is best to visit your veterinarian as soon as possible to have him determine the extent of the damage.</p>
