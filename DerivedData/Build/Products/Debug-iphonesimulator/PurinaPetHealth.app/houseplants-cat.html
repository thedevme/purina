    	 <h1>Is it dangerous for my pet to nibble on houseplants?</h1> <p class="medium">Your pet might have a passion for houseplants, but some common varieties can make your pet sick, and a few may even be deadly.</p> <p class="medium">More than 240 types of houseplants are considered hazardous to pets. But it all depends on what part of the plant the animal eats. For examples, the poisonous part of the amaryllis is the bulb, which can cause nausea, vomiting, and even paralysis in pets.</p> <p class="medium">Other plants, such as the crown-of-thorns and some cacti, only cause skin reactions. Poinsettias also irritate pets, although the effects are not as bad as they are rumored to be.</p> <p class="medium">If your pet does ingest something that you suspect is poisonous, call the ASPCA Animal Poison Center at 888-4-ANIHELP. Charges may apply.</p><br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
