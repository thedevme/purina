    	<h1>Maintaining a Healthy Weight</h1> <p class="medium">Dog owners can take several different steps to help control their dog's weight.</p> <p class="medium">The first is to cut back on treats and snacks. These are generally high in calories and may contribute to weight gain.</p> <p class="medium">The second step can be to feed less of the regular dog food. This usually means measuring the amount of food that's put into the dog's dish to prevent the serving size from increasing over time. Remember that the suggesting serving amount on the package of dog food is a guideline based on average dogs. An individual dog may need less, or more, than the average amount.</p> <p class="medium">Third, owners can increase a dog's exercise with additional walks or playtime each day. This may help the owner as well as the dog, and has the additional benefit of increasing the amount of time the dog and owner spend together.</p> <p class="medium">Finally, a dog owner could consider switching to a low-calorie food. These products are designed to allow an owner to serve a nice-size portion while still reducing the calories the dog eats. It is always a good idea to consult with a veterinarian before putting a dog on a weight-loss program. The veterinarian can help tailor a weight-loss program for an individual dog and can track progress and help troubleshoot along the way.</p>
