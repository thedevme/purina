    	<h1>Why has my cat suddenly stopped using the litter box?</h1> <p class="medium">If your cat stops using the litter box, don't punish him - try to find out why. If you have multiple cats in your house, make sure you have enough litter boxes. A good rule of thumb is to have one more box than you have cats. So two cats require three boxes.</p>
 <p class="medium">Like humans, most felines want privacy. So if your cat stops using the litter box, try putting a hood on it. Place the box where it's accessible, but away from where your cat eats and sleeps. You could also try changing the type of litter - some cats dislike the scented kinds. And make sure the box is roomy with low sides for easy entry and exit. Change the litter box and wash the box often. If the house-soiling problem continues, consult your veterinarian.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
