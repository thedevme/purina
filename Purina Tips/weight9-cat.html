    	<h1>How can I get my fat and lazy cat to exercise?</h1> <p class="medium">Just like humans, cats can lose weight by exercising. Veterinarian Margee Scherk, Editor of the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery, says there are a lot of ways to get an obese cat up and moving.</p>
 <p class="medium">Just ten minutes of play each day can turn a bored, overweight cat potato into a happy, healthy kitty. When chasing a dangling feather, or a catnip mouse tossed by their favorite human, even senior cats can turn kittenish. And the playtime can be a fun bonding experience for you and your favorite feline.</p> <br><i>Dr. Andrea Looney, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
