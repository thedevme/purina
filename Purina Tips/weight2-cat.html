    	<h1>My cat is losing weight even though she eats well. What could be the problem?</h1> <p class="medium">Is your older cat high-strung? Does she lose weight but eat like a pig? She may have an overactive thyroid. Older cats sometimes begin producing too much thyroid hormone. It's a condition called feline hyperthyroidism. Veterinarians don't know what causes it, but it speeds up the cat's metabolism, causing a gradual weight loss and hyperactivity. In fact, hyperthyroid kitties are so high-strung, it can seem as if they've had a few too many cups of coffee! They will also drink and urinate a lot, and may lose hair, vomit, or have a goiter or thyroid nodule.</p> <p class="medium">If your cat displays any of the symptoms, contact your veterinarian. A blood test can detect the disease, and with appropriate treatment, a cat with hyperthyroidism can live a normal life.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
