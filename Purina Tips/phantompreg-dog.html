    	<h1>What is a Phantom Pregnancy?</h1> <p class="medium">If your female dog is acting like she's expecting, don't necessarily anticipate new pups. Mothering a soft toy and even lactating are common signs of a phantom pregnancy. This can happen at any age, and includes symptoms like abdominal swelling, appetite loss, and vomiting.</p> <p class="medium">But rest easy. A dog's estrus cycle naturally includes a period of false pregnancy after she's been in heat, and it usually resolves itself without treatment. If it gets out of hand, your veterinarian may recommend medication as a temporary solution. But he'll test your dog first to avoid falsely calling Betsy's bluff.</p> <p class="medium">Spaying is a permanent solution, but only consider it after symptoms are over, otherwise it may prolong the false pregnancy.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
