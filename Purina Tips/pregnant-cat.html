    	<h1>At what age can my cat become pregnant?</h1> <p class="medium">If you've just introduced an un-spayed kitten into your household, you may want to know when her feline biological clock will start ticking.</p> <p class="medium">Kittens as young as four months can go into their first heat. The timing may vary from breed to breed, but the signs are always clear - if kitty starts rubbing against your leg or rolling around on the living room carpet, she's entering feline adulthood.</p> <p class="medium">Not only can cats conceive at a young age - old age doesn't stop them either because cats don't have the equivalent of menopause. And don't think that just because kitty is nursing she's taking a break. A new mom can become pregnant again even before she has finished weaning her previous litter.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
