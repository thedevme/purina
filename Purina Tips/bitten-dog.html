    	<h1>What happens if an un-vaccinated dog is bitten by a rabid animal?</h1> <p class="medium">You may have seen a wild animal with rabies acting erratically, like a raccoon, out in the middle of the day.</p> <p class="medium">If an un-vaccinated dog is exposed to rabies, you may not notice for several weeks. But once the symptoms start, the disease progresses quickly. At first, a rabid dog may develop anxiety and a fever. But shortly thereafter, it will enter the furious stage, becoming irritable and aggressive. Slowly, muscle function will disappear, and the dog will struggle to swallow, often foaming at the mouth. You might also observe its tongue hanging out. Eventually, the dog will not be able breathe and will die from asphyxiation.</p> <p class="medium">There is no treatment for rabies, so be sure to have your dog vaccinated.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
