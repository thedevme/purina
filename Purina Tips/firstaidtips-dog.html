     <h1>Emergency First Aid Tips</h1> <p class="medium">In an emergency, keep a level head and quickly get your cat to the veterinarian. Call first. If your doctor's office is not open, call the nearest emergency pet clinic. Keep emergency phone numbers near your telephone.</p> <p class="medium">Unless you have been trained and are absolutely positive you can administer CPR to your cat, it is best - and safer - to seek immediate veterinary care.</p> <p class="medium">There are some things you can do or avoid doing to help your cat before you get her to the hospital/clinic as soon as possible:</p> <ul><li>Wrap your cat in a heavy towel or blanket to keep her warm and restrict her movements. Having assistance may be helpful.</li> <li>Apply a pressure bandage (sterile gauze or a clean handkerchief) to stem or stop the bleeding of a cut or bite.</li> <li>Apply a cold compress to a burn and gently hold it there until you get to the veterinary clinic.</li> <li>Do not induce vomiting even if you suspect or know your cat has swallowed a poisonous substance.</li> <li>At any sign of choking (drooling, difficulty swallowing, pawing at the mouth, gagging), do not attempt to remove the item.</li> <li>If your cat suffers heatstroke, take her to a cool spot and sponge her with cool water. Encourage your cat to drink small amounts of water.</li> <li>If your cat suffers frostbite, place her in a warm room immediately. Thaw out the frostbitten areas slowly by applying warm moist towels that are changed frequently until the area becomes flushed. Severe frostbite can result in damaged paws and ear tips, so it is best to visit your veterinarian as soon as possible, to have him determine the extent of the damage.</li>
