    	 <h1>What is tooth resorption?</h1> <p class="medium">Tooth resorption is a dental condition in which an animal develops a lesion in the crown or root of a tooth. It can show itself as a tooth fracture, or be hidden beneath the gumline.</p> <p class="medium">Tooth resorption occurs commonly in cats - about one in two cats have it - so feline dentists check for the condition routinely. Dogs can acquire the problem as well, but rarely do.</p> <p class="medium">If you notice changes in your pet's eating habits, increased salivation, or inflamed gums, consider making a trip to the veterinarian. He or she will take radiographs to determine the affected teeth and stage of disease. Treatment may involve tooth extraction. To find out more, talk to your veterinarian or a veterinary dental specialist</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
