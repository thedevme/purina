    	<h1>How do I know if my dog has heatstroke?</h1> <p class="medium">Bright sun. Hot day. No shade. These factors can spell trouble for your furry friend. If your dog looks dazed or can't get up, he may have heat stroke. This condition can damage the brain and the gastrointestinal system, and can be lethal to your pup. So call your veterinarian right away if you suspect a problem. Your dog might need immediate medical attention.</p> <p class="medium">Never use ice to bring your dog's temperature down, as that might do more harm than good. Instead, cool the dog slowly by putting alcohol on his pads, and wrapping him in cool towels or giving him a lukewarm bath. Make sure the dog has a drink of water as soon as possible.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
