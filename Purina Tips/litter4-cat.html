    	<h1>What might I consider when choosing a litterbox for my cat?</h1> <p class="medium">Litterboxes may all look more or less the same to you, but probably not to your cat. Jackie Neilson, a Veterinary Behaviorist in Portland, Oregon, says cats prefer litterboxes with certain amenities.</p>
 <p class="medium">Her research shows, for example, that many cats prefer clay-based, clumping litter to other types. Choosy felines like their litterbox to smell nice, too, with carbon being the top choice for odor control. In terms of size, most cats like litter boxes roomy - the bigger, the better. But each cat has its preferences, so you might want to experiment to find out the products that your cat likes best.</p> <br><i>Dr. Andrea Looney, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
