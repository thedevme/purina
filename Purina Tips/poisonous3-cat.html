    	 <h1>What common outdoor plants are poisonous to pets?</h1> <p class="medium">Ornamental plants add color to our lawns, but some of them pose a hidden danger to our pets.</p> <p class="medium">Some common garden plants can trigger depression, tremors, and even death in your cat or dog. Among the most dangerous plants are rhododendrons, azaleas, oleander, and hyacinths. Daffodils, tulips, and irises can also irritate your pet's mouth and gastrointestinal tract.</p> <p class="medium">Usually, an animal will stop eating a plant before he consumes a fatal amount. But some plants, like oleander, can kill in very small doses. So the best policy is to keep your pet out of the garden! And if he eats anything suspicious, immediately call the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center at 888-4-ANIHELP. Charges may apply.</p> <br><i>Dr. Andrea Looney, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
