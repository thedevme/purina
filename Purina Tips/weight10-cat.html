    	<h1>What are some possible causes of weight loss in cats?</h1> <p class='medium'>If your cat is shedding pounds - not just fur - it's important to get him checked out by a veterinarian. Although stress is one of the most common causes of weight loss in cats, there are also a host of medical conditions that could be to blame.</p>
 <p class='medium'>Parasites, heartworm, cancer, feline leukemia virus, giardia, and kidney disease are only some of the potential reasons for weight loss in cats. With so many possible causes, there's no sense guessing what's wrong - you need an official diagnosis from a veterinarian. So take note of other symptoms - is your cat eating? Does he have diarrhea? How has his behavior changed? Observe your cat carefully and then take him in for a thorough exam.</p> <br><i>Dr. Andrea Looney, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
