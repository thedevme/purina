    	<h1>What should I consider when purchasing a new dog leash?</h1> <p class="medium">The best leash allows you to communicate with your dog and keep him under control. A six-foot leather or nylon lead is the standard for taking walks and basic obedience training. Nylon can be rough on your hands, but is more durable than leather. Avoid chain leashes, which can injure you or your pooch, or leashes with decorations that can come off and choke your dog.</p> <p class="medium">Retractable leads can come in lengths up to twenty-six feet. They're great for giving Sam more freedom and teaching him to come when called. Look for one with non-slip handles, a sturdy lock with a quick release, a smooth rewind, and reflective tape to keep you both visible at night. Bigger dogs need wider leashes, so know your pet's approximate weight.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
