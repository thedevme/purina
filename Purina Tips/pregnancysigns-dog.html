    	<h1>What are the first signs of pregnancy in a dog? </h1><p class="medium">If you suspect that your dog is pregnant, the best way to find out for sure is to take her to the veterinarian. However, there are some possible clues that you might look for at home. For example, you may notice that your dog seeks your attention more often. Pregnant dogs can also have ravenous appetites. Finally, you might observe enlarged mammary glands and a clear, vaginal discharge that appears about a month into the pregnancy.</p> <p class="medium">These signs may indicate that your dog is pregnant, but they are by no means a diagnosis. If you suspect that your dog may soon be a momma, take her in for an exam. The veterinarian will palpate the uterus or perform an ultrasound to confirm the pregnancy.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
