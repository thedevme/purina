    	<h1>My cat has been losing a lot of weight recently, even though her diet hasn't changed. What might be the problem?</h1> <p class="medium">Has your cat been shedding more pounds than hair lately? Is her rich fur coat looking dull? These could be signs of roundworm.</p> <p class="medium">Roundworms are spaghetti-like parasites around three to five inches long that may appear in Fluffy's feces. These uninvited guests take out a temporary lease on your cat's intestine, where they steal some of kitty's chow before it is digested.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
