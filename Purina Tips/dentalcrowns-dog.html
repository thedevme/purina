     <h1>Can dogs get dental crowns?</h1> <p class="medium">The process of crowning damaged teeth is common in human dentistry. Gerrianne Holzman, a Certified Veterinary Technician who specializes in dentristry, says dogs can also get dental crowns: "and that's a crown just like it would be done in people.&quot;</p> <p class="medium">Not all dogs get their bad teeth crowned. Holzman says most companion animals manage to get along fine without all their teeth, so damaged teeth are often extracted. But working dogs, such as police dogs, really need strong, healthy teeth. If their pearly whites become cracked or broken, they cannot perform up to par. Dental crowns are the perfect solution for them. It's a pricey procedure, but a valuable working dog is worth the expense.</p> <br><i>Dr. Andrea Looney, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
