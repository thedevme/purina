    	<h1>My cat is going to have kittens. What possible complications should I look for?</h1> <p class="medium">Autumn Davidson, a Veterinary Internist at the University of California-Davis says cats have very few problems giving birth, but you can take steps to ensure your queen has a smooth pregnancy and delivery.</p> <p class="medium">A pre-partum check-up before breeding will make sure your cat is healthy and ready to carry her litter for the nine- week term. Then a follow-up exam and ultrasound at four weeks will allow your veterinarian to determine the number of kittens. A small litter may mean large kittens and therefore possible delivery complications. Before the big event, Davidson suggests preparing a box in an out of the way space. She says, "queens need a quiet, warm, secure, private place to have their kittens.&quot;</p> <p class="medium">After the birthing, watch to make sure the mama and kittens bond.</p> <br><i>Dr. Andrea Looney, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
