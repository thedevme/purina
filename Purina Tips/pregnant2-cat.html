    	<h1>What are the first signs of pregnancy in a cat?</h1> <p class="medium">Pregnancy in cats lasts about nine weeks. But early signs are easy to miss. About three weeks after mating, an expectant cat's nipples become enlarged and pinker. To find out for sure if your cat is pregnant, take her to your veterinarian. Fetal heartbeats can be detected by ultrasound around day twenty-four.</p> <p class="medium">Around week five, a pregnant cat's abdomen starts to swell noticeably. Like pregnant humans, pregnant cats tend to sleep more and eat more. But unlike humans, cat moms may be eating for eight--or more! Her personality may also change. She may become more affectionate, and seek more attention. By all means, give it to her!</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
