    	<h1>How can I help my cat lose weight?</h1> <p class="medium">Does your cat have an apron of fat where his figure-eight waist ought to be? When a feline becomes obese, all that weight becomes a threat to his health and longevity. So if your precious puss is packing on the pounds, stop that trend in its tracks. Liz Rozanski is a veterinarian at Tufts University.</p> <p class="medium">Most successful weight loss programs are early identification of a pet at risk, and then being very conscientious with it - working with your veterinarian or one of the nurses at the practice, making sure you really understand what's happening from a nutritional standpoint.</p> <p class="medium">Your veterinarian will help you devise a diet that meets your cat's needs. And make sure to play with that pudgy kitty - regular exercise will help him shed the weight.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
