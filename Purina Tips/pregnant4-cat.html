    	<h1>My cat is going to have kittens, what happens during a normal delivery?</h1> <p class="medium">The week before labor begins, provide your pregnant cat with a warm, quiet area, and lots of towels. When delivery time is near, you may notice restless behavior, and constant washing of the genital area. The mother-to-be may breath rapidly, meow loudly, or pace around. As contractions begin, she may lie on her side, or squat and strain downward. The first kitten should arrive within an hour. Siblings may follow immediately, or a few hours apart. Cats average four to six kittens per litter.</p> <p class="medium">With the arrival of each kitten, the mother cat severs the umbilical cord, expels the placenta, and licks the newborn clean. Should difficulties arise, be sure to have your veterinarian's phone number close at hand.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
