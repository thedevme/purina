    	<h1>Is it true that a single litter can include kittens from multiple sires?</h1> <p class="medium">When a cat is in estrus - or heat as it is commonly known - she will have one item on her agenda... mating. At this time, kitty's behavior will exhibit some dramatic changes, including an increase in affection, purring, and rubbing. Her lurking and loud calls will signal any nearby Casanovas to "come hither.&quot;</p> <p class="medium">Since a cat is in heat for up to ten days, multiple tomcat Romeos may win the fight to woo the queen - and succeed in impregnating her. When this happens, more than one daddy can vouch for the kittens.</p> <p class="medium">One tell-tale sign of a multiple sire scenario is a multi-colored litter. Although mama's genetics may account for the diversity, a kitten cocktail is strong evidence of multiple mating.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
