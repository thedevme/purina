    	<h1>What is the best behavior advice for new puppy owners?</h1> <p>To raise a well-behaved puppy, first, take the time to learn the developmental stages in a young dog's life - like the difference between imprinting and socialization. What happens in puppy puberty? And what's this \"alpha dog\" thing all about? As the alpha human, you'll want to know what to expect.</p> <p>Second, keep that dog in school - puppy kindergarten, basic and advanced obedience, and \"canine good citizen\" classes - so his canine brain stays actively engaged in learning new skills. Sports training can be fun, too – just wait til that dog tries flyball! Or consider training your pup to be a pet-therapy dog.</p> <p>Behavior training is a lifelong endeavor, and a great way to stay out of trouble.</p> <br><i>– Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the “Purina® Animal Instincts” Podcast Series</i>
