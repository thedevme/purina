<h1>My dog is going to have puppies. What happens during a normal delivery?</h1> <p>If your dog’s expecting, here’s what you should expect on the big day. Within twenty-four hours of giving birth, your dog will likely become very restless and may reject food. Walk her often during this time, so she has a chance to urinate and defecate before the delivery.</p> <p>When her water has broken, you may notice her licking her vulva. Soon contractions will begin, and you’ll know the puppies are on their way. Usually, they’ll appear head first, belly down, covered by a membrane. Your dog will lick them to remove this sac and the umbilical cord. Giving birth is no easy task, so after each puppy, your dog will rest. Stay with her, and if more than a few hours go by without another puppy appearing, call your veterinarian.</p> <br><i>– Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the “Purina® Animal Instincts” Podcast Series</i>
