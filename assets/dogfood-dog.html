    	<h1>Why is it important for me to be able to handle my dog's food and take treats away from him? How can I safely teach my dog to let me do this?</h1> <p>Make no bones about it! Food is precious to a dog, so his instinct is to guard it.</p> <p>Debra Horwitz, a board certified Veterinary Behaviorist from St. Louis, Missouri, states, “if we want dogs be aware that we can handle their food and other possessions safely, then we need to do it in a way that’s not threatening.”</p> <p>She says that if you punish a hungry hound for growling when you try to take away his food, you teach the dog to link your command with punishment. So create a positive association by giving your dog a treat while you practice removing his meal.</p> <p>The goal is to teach Buster the “drop” and “leave it” commands so you can get back things like your favorite pair of shoes when needed.</p> <br><i>– Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the “Purina® Animal Instincts” Podcast Series</i>
