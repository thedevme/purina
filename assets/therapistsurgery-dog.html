    	<h1>How will a physical therapist work with my dog after surgery?</h1> <p>If you ever had orthopedic surgery - maybe for your knee or your shoulder - you know the importance of post-operative physical therapy. Janet Van Dyke is a veterinarian at the Canine Rehabilitation Institute says new surgeries are being developed, especially minimally invasive surgeries, to repair the injuries around the shoulder, and then we have specific rehab techniques that are being applied to these patients with the intent of getting them back to full peak performance.</p> Those healing techniques may include movement and exercise, stretching, heat and cold therapy, or hydrotherapy. Combined with pain management, they will help get your dog back in the running.</p> <br><i>– Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the “Purina® Animal Instincts” Podcast Series</i>
