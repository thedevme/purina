    	<h1>Why is obesity so dangerous for pets?</h1> <p class="medium">For years, antibiotics have been used to destroy bad bacteria in a pet's body. Now many veterinarians are also considering how to promote the growth of good bacteria in a pet's body using nutrition. Sherry Sanderson is an Associate Professor at the University of Georgia.</p> <p class="medium">Sanderson says, "prebiotics are actually non-digestible ingredients that are added to the diet that when they reach the large intestines act as a source of nutrition for those large intestinal bacteria and promote good bacteria to thrive in the large intestines.&quot;</p> <p class="medium">These so-called good bacteria produce energy for the cells that line the intestines and aid in the production of nutrients.</p> <p class="medium">One of the most common prebiotics found in pet food is fiber, which may be listed on the label as beet pulp.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
