    	<h1>How do I know how much exercise my pet can handle after surgery?</h1> <p class="medium">After your pet has had an operation, you may wonder how quickly he can resume his normal exercise routine. Jackie Davidson, a Professor at Louisiana State University, says the amount of activity a pet can handle is determined by the type of surgery involved.</p> <p class="medium">Davidson states, "as a general rule, you want to keep them ... quiet ... usually until the stitches come out.&quot;.</p> <p class="medium">With minor surgeries such as spaying, Davidson says your pet could be back to his lively self in about a week. But with orthopedic, neurologic, and other major surgeries, recovery could take several weeks or more. While your pet's recuperating, keep him as quiet as possible - indoors, in a clean, dry environment. Outdoors, your pet could tear out stitches or pick up an infection.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
