    	<h1>Why does my dog suddenly have a pot belly?</h1> <p class="medium">If your pet suddenly has a pot belly, it's no laughing matter. A distended abdomen can be dangerous. When a dog becomes bloated, gas or fluid fills his stomach and stretches it full. Although the bloating may just go away, the stomach can twist on itself. This condition - called gastric torsion - is serious, and can even be life-threatening. If a dog develops gastric torsion, surgeons will need to untwist the stomach and try to repair any damage to the stomach wall.</p> <p class="medium">Large breeds of dogs such as Labs, Irish Wolfhounds, and Boxers tend to be the most susceptible to gastric torsion. So if your dog's at risk and develops a distended belly, immediately discuss the problem with your veterinarian.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
