    	<h1>What are some possible causes of weight loss in dogs?</h1> <p class="medium">Is your canine losing weight, almost like he's counting calories? If so, you'll need to take him to the veterinarian.</p> There are a variety of possible medical causes for weight loss - diet, parasites, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease, just to name a few. To make a diagnosis, your veterinarian will likely ask you about other symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting. So take note of any changes in your dog's health or behavior, and consider bringing a stool sample to your veterinarian. At the appointment, the veterinarian will examine your pet, and may run a series of tests, such as x-rays, blood tests, or a urinalysis. Then he or she will make an official diagnosis.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
