    	<h1>How do I train an outdoor cat to start using an indoor litter box?</h1> <p class="medium">If you want to turn an outdoor cat into an indoor pet, the first thing you'll need to teach him is how to use the litter box. It's easier than you think - cats are naturally inclined to go in sand or fine particles.</p>
 <p class="medium">First confine your cat to a bathroom or other room with no absorbent surfaces except his litter box. Play with him often. When he starts to use the litter box regularly, give him more and more time outside of the room, but watch him closely. Eventually, put another litter box where you really want the box to stay. Location is key - make sure the box is in a quiet, easy-to-access place, away from the cat's food and water. Wait for your feline friend to use the new litter box before you remove the first.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
