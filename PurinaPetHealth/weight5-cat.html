    	<h1>How do I know if my cat is overweight?</h1> <p class="medium">Humans aren't the only ones living large. The obesity epidemic is affecting our cats, too. In fact, between twenty-five and forty percent of pet cats are obese or likely to become obese.</p> <p class="medium">Unfortunately, cat owners don't always realize that their once-trim tabby has become a fat feline. Without proper weight management, their cats continue to grow - and become at higher risk for diabetes, arthritis, and other conditions.</p> <p class="medium">So keep an eye on your cat's weight. When you pat her, gently press down. If you are unable to feel her ribs, consider taking her to the veterinarian for a proper exam. After ruling out any underlying medical causes, your veterinarian can help you develop an appropriate nutrition and exercise plan.</p> <br><i>Dr. Larry McDaniel, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
