    	<h1>Housetraining</h1> <p class="medium">Unless you can catch him in the act, it really does not do any good to your dog to drag him off to the site of his mishap and try and punish him. Keep your dog in sight and if tries something in front of you, say "No,&quot; get his attention, and take him outdoors quickly so he can finish eliminating in the appropriate area. Remember, it is your house. He has to earn his freedom through good behavior and this is your responsibility.</p> <p class="medium">The first step in housetraining is to decide whether your pup will be trained to only eliminate outdoors or have the option of using a dog litter. If you plan on using a dog litter, click here for more information on the Purina secondnature&#174; brand Dog Litter system.</p> <p class="medium">If your dog will be trained to eliminate only outdoors, start by establishing an elimination spot. In the morning, clip his leash to his collar and take the dog outdoors to his spot for elimination. State commands like "go potty&quot; or "hurry up.&quot; After he does his duty, bring the dog inside for food and water. About 15 to 20 minutes after the meal, take the dog outside again for elimination. Take your dog to his "spot&quot; at each elimination time and maintain a regular feeding, drinking, and elimination schedule.</p> <p class="medium">One of the most commonly made errors in housetraining is rushing too quickly ahead of your dog. Too much freedom too quickly can cause some confusion. If your dog experiences an accident or two, you should back up and slow down your training efforts. Marking should not be confused with housetraining problems because marking is deliberate. It is advised that if you notice this behavior indoors or out, you should strengthen all obedience commands immediately.</p> <p class="medium">Providing your dog or puppy with a crate that is way too large may allow him to relieve himself in one end and sleep in the other. Make sure you take your dog or puppy outdoors to eliminate on a regular schedule and especially prior to being left for prolonged periods of time.</p> <p class="medium">If you have tried all the above and are still experiencing what you believe to be "Territorial Marking,&quot; consult your veterinarian. Your dog/puppy may have a bladder infection and it's always best to be safe, not sorry. If your dog/puppy is not spayed or neutered, you may want to talk to your veterinarian about this procedure. It usually has a very positive effect on this type of behavior.</p> <p class="medium">Even well-trained dogs sometimes have accidents. Clean the accident area with a pet odor neutralizer so your dog won't be tempted to repeat his mistake. Here are some tips to help prevent accidents:</p> <ul><li>Do not make sudden changes in his diet.</li> <li>Avoid giving your dog late night snacks.</li> <li>Make sure to spend enough time outdoors.</li></ul>
