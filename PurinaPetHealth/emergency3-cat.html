    	<h1>I'm putting a first aid kit together for my pet, what should I include?</h1> <p class="medium">You never know when you might have an emergency with your cat or dog, so it's important to know what to include in a pet safety kit.</p> <p class="medium">When it comes to pet emergencies, it's critical to have your vet's phone number and the national poison control hotline within easy reach. Other things to keep on hand include a saline solution that can be used to flush out your pet's eyes; a muzzle in case your pet gets badly hurt; and a turkey baster to help get medicine down. Forceps, rubber gloves, and soft pet food are useful items, too.</p> <p class="medium">You should also be prepared for a potential poisoning. Keep a bottle of hydrogen peroxide in your pet safety kit in case your veterinarian asks you to induce vomiting.</p> <p class="medium">And remember: if you do need to take a sick or injured pet to the veterinarian, you'll need access to a sturdy pet carrier.</p> <br><i>Dr. Andrea Looney, DVM for the "Purina&#174; Animal Instincts" Podcast Series</i>
